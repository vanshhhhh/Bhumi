A plant disease classification system is used to identify the possible cause of a plant disease. It takes a picture of the plant's leaf and then uses a statistical method to analyze the data. Usually, diseases appear in the leaves, fruits, and buds. When a plant gets infected, it can cause the fruit to be wasted or damaged.
Besides being harmful to the plant, these diseases can also lead to the development of new infections. It's important to identify the disease in advance and take the necessary precautions to prevent it from spreading to other trees. This project aims to develop a system that can identify and treat plant diseases using Convolution Neural Networks.
The development of this system will help in the timely diagnosis and treatment of plant diseases, which are known to have a significant impact on the agricultural industry.
The presence of pests and diseases can affect the production of various crops and plants in the country. Usually, professionals and farmers inspect the plants in order to identify and treat the diseases. However, this method can be very time-consuming and costly. This is why it's important to develop a system that can help identify plant diseases.
The goal of this paper is to develop a system that can identify plant diseases using a combination of image processing and leaf image classification. In order to perform this task, we're using a Convolutional Neural Network. This type of artificial neural network is designed to process pixel input.
